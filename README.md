================================

This paper presents the mechanism of Intelligent
Adaptive Curiosity. This is a drive
which pushes the robot towards situations in
which it maximizes its learning progress. It
makes the robot focus on situations which
are neither too predictable nor too unpredictable.
This mechanism is a source of selfdevelopment
for the robot: the complexity of
its activity autonomously increases. Indeed,
we show that it first spends time in situations
which are easy to learn,then shifts progressively
its attention to situations of increasing
difficulty,avoiding situations in which nothing
can be learnt.
